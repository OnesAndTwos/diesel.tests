## Introduction

This was put together to experiment with different JavaScript UI Testing Frameworks to help with defining the Delta Team E2E testing strategy. It includes three different testing frameworks; casper, zombie and dalek. 

Since the Delta Team are already experimenting with Dalek and other teams use it, that is the Framework that I have fleshed out the most. 

## Setup

You will need to install node and the following npm modules globally would be helpfull.

```
npm install --global gulp
npm install --global dalek-cli
```

## Running it

You can run the Dalek tests with:

```
gulp dalek
```
